# Full-Stack Application: Overview of Software Development Process

This project demonstrates the development of a full-stack application using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **SQLite3**, **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and deployment to **Render**. It provides an end-to-end understanding of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), including planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## Features

- **Frontend (React):** A responsive, dynamic UI for users to interact with the app.
- **Backend (Node.js + Express):** Handles API requests and business logic.
- **Database (SQLite3):** Persistent data storage with a lightweight relational database.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Render for public access.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A Render account (for deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-app.git
   cd fullstack-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Running the App

### Run Locally

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Docker Setup

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t fullstack-app .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -d fullstack-app
   ```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate testing, building, and deployment.

- Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`.
- Every push to `main` triggers:
  - **Linting and Testing:** Ensures code quality.
  - **Build and Deployment:** Automatically deploys to Render.

---

## Deployment

The app is deployed to **Render** for public access.

1. Link your GitHub repository to Render.
2. Configure build commands:
   - **Backend:** `npm install && npm start`
   - **Frontend:** `npm install && npm run build`
